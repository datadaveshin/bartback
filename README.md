# BARTBack

A Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) app.

## Description

BARTBack separates itself from other BART apps, as the intention was not to simply recreate BART's mobile website app and repackage it in a different interface - meaning redesign the front end.

Instead, BARTBack separates itself in that it is/will be a single-page app, for the main parts, that allows the user to determine train crowding and a strategy for getting a seat specific to their individual commute.
